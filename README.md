## How It Works

The Gold Dragon AI MT5 expert advisor works by utilizing machine learning algorithms to analyze market conditions and generate trading signals. The code provided demonstrates the basic structure and functionality of the expert advisor.

The code includes the necessary libraries for trading and accessing the AI model. It defines constants for trading parameters such as lot size, stop loss, take profit, trailing stop, and break-even. It also declares global variables for the trading and AI objects.

The `OnInit()` function is called when the expert advisor is initialized. It initializes the AI model by calling the `Init()` method of the AI object.

The `OnTick()` function is called on each tick of the market. It retrieves the current market price and the previous price from the AI object. It then checks if the market conditions meet the trading criteria by calling the `CheckTradingCriteria()` method of the AI object. If the criteria are met, it generates a trading signal using the `GenerateSignal()` method and executes buy or sell orders based on the signal using the `Buy()` or `Sell()` methods of the trade object.

The `OnDeinit()` function is called when the expert advisor is deinitialized. It records the trading results and performance metrics by calling the respective methods of the trade object. It also generates a performance report and statistical analysis using the `ReturnOnInvestment()`, `Drawdown()`, and `GeneratePerformanceReport()` methods of the trade object. The trading results and performance metrics are then displayed to the user.

The `OnChartEvent()` function is called when a chart event occurs, such as a key press. It updates the trading parameters based on the user input. For example, pressing 'L' increases the lot size, 'S' decreases the lot size, 'T' increases the take profit level, and 'D' decreases the take profit level.

Please note that this is a simplified version of the code and the actual implementation may contain additional features and functionalities.
